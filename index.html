For a European Citizens Initiative to be successful, it needs to reach 1,000,000 signatures overall and a minimum amount of signatures (quorum) in at least seven EU member states. This map shows how the number of signatures is divided by country and what percentage of the quorum has already been reached. The darker the blue, the higher the percentage.

The darker the blue, the more signatures collected in the country.

A minimum number of statements of support has to be reached in a country. The darker the blue, the more signatures. Countries in dark blue have the required number of signatures, an ECI needs at least 7 countries.
